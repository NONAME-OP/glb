📦 CHAOSEVERYWHERE

A modern web-based interactive experience built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, structured with a bundler workflow and optimized build output.
This project appears to be designed for creating chaotic, experimental, or dynamic UI interactions — suitable for web demos, creative coding projects, or browser-based games.

🚀 Features

⚡ Modular JavaScript Structure (inside src/)

🎨 Custom UI Styling (CSS-based designs)

🏗️ Bundler Support (likely Webpack/Vite/Rollup — based on bundler/ folder)

📁 Production Build (in dist/)

🌐 Static Assets Handling (static/ folder)

📑 Loading Page Template (LOADING_PAGE_README.md)
